## Abstract

Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of chromatin, wrapping DNA around histone octamers and shaping genome accessibility. Their genomic positioning is a key determinant of transcriptional regulation, replication, and DNA repair. While sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning has been extensively studied in yeast, its determinants in mammalian genomes remain less well understood due to increased genome size, sequence complexity, and the abundance of repetitive elements.

In this thesis, we investigate the extent to which DNA sequence alone contributes to nucleosome positioning in mammals. We leverage high-resolution nucleosome occupancy maps and develop deep learning models trained directly on genomic sequences to predict nucleosome positioning signals. Using interpretable deep neural network approaches, including *in silico* mutagenesis and perturbation-based analyses, we identify both known and previously underappreciated sequence features influencing nucleosome organization.

Our results highlight the role of transcription factor motifs, microsatellites, and repetitive elements as strong contributors to nucleosome positioning. Beyond prediction accuracy, this work provides mechanistic insights into how local and long-range sequence patterns shape chromatin structure in mammalian genomes, with implicatio
